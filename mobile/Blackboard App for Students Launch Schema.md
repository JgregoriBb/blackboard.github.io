# Blackboard App for Students Launch Schema

## Bb Student is now Blackboard

As of June 2017, Bb Student is now known as Blackboard. The appâ€™s functions
remain the same. For consistency, the app-to-app launch schemas will change
and the older ones using the bbstudent:// prefix will be deprecated. As with
any deprecation, we are informing you, the developer, that we plan to remove
this functionality at a later date. The purpose of this deprecation is to
provide the time necessary to migrate your application from one scheme to the
other. At this time, there is no firm date at which this change will take
place. We will use usage data to inform that decision, and once a date is
selected and confirmed, we will make an announcement. As part of the
deprecation process, all new links will require the new blackboard:// URL
scheme.
