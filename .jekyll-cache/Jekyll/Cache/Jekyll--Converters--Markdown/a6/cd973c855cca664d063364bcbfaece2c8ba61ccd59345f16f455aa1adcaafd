<p>Blackboard Learn provides access to sample code to help Developers build
against the Blackboard Web Services. This sample code is accessible directly
from the Blackboard Learn User Interface. The download comes in the form of a
zip archive and contains a number of build-able projects. These projects can
be re-used in conjunction with the license contained in the root directory of
the zip archive.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-it">How To Get It</h2>

<p>Any user with access to the Web Services section of the System Administrator
panel can download the Web Services Sample Code and Javadoc-based Web Services
API documentation.</p>
