</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. USE OF THE APIS, DOCUMENTATION AND DVBAS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the Term hereof, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the APIs and Documentation for the sole purpose of developing Developer Applications which are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications. 
2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent Blackboard makes available to Developer a DVBA which is downloadable to a device in Developer‚Äôs computing environment, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download and install a single, object-code copy of the DVBA, but: (a) for use only as a component of the Developer‚Äôs non-production development environment; and (b) solely for the purpose of testing the interoperability of the Developer Application with a DVBA in such non-production development environment by making requests from the Developer Application, in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to enable the exchange of data between the applications.
3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent that Blackboard makes available to Developer a Blackboard-hosted Software-as-a-Service (‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù) version of a DVBA, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access the DVBA on a remote access basis over the Internet solely for the purpose of testing the interoperability of the Developer Application with the DVBA in a non-production development environment by making requests from the Developer Application, in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to enable the exchange of data between the applications. 
4. The DVBA will include usage and other limitations in order to ensure that Developer makes use of such Blackboard Application only for development and testing purposes. In this regard, unless stated otherwise on the Portal, Developer shall be limited to use of the DVBA for no more than 150 users, 100 courses and 1,000 enrollment records. In addition, Developer shall be provided with ‚Äútesting level‚Äù usage limits (such as quotas, bandwidth limits and/or rate limits) in connection with its use of the DVBAs. Such limitations will be as designated or applied by Blackboard in its sole discretion. Additional usage, technical, licensing or other limitations may be applied by Blackboard in its sole discretion. Developer is solely responsible for testing the Developer Application, for determining whether it is interoperable with a DVBA and thus a Blackboard Application, and for abiding by all applicable limitations and restrictions.

Except as expressly permitted in the Agreement, Developer may not: (a) disclose, distribute (including by uploading to web sites, electronic bulletin boards or on or through any other method or media), display, sublicense, sell, or transfer any rights in the APIs, the Documentation or any DVBA (collectively, the ‚ÄúBlackboard Property‚Äù), in whole or in part, to any third party; (b) use the Blackboard Property, in whole or in part, for service bureau or outsourcing use or otherwise for the use or benefit of any third party; (c) exceed applicable usage, technical, licensing or other limitations which are set forth in this Agreement, in any materials or documentation provided by Blackboard or as may be separately imposed by Blackboard; (d) copy, modify, alter, or create derivative works of, or otherwise use for any purpose other than the purpose expressly authorized hereunder, the Blackboard Property; (e) use the Blackboard Property to create any product or service similar to any Blackboard Property or Blackboard Application, or otherwise exploit or commercialize the Blackboard Property; (f) gain or seek to gain access to any DVBA or Blackboard Application other than through the APIs as contemplated herein; (g) reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt or decompile the APIs or any DVBA or Blackboard Application, or otherwise make any attempt to access or discover the source code thereof, or interfere with or disrupt the APIs, DVBAs, or Blackboard Applications or any servers or networks through which they are provided; (h) permit any third party to access or use the Blackboard Property, or to resell, distribute or otherwise use or exercise any rights with respect thereto;  disable any ‚Äúauto reporting option‚Äù or similar reporting capability in any DVBA; or (j) provide any services or support to any third party regarding, or in connection with, any Blackboard Property.
8. A DVBA may utilize or include third party software or content (‚ÄúThird Party Software‚Äù). To the extent necessary to use the applicable DVBA, Blackboard grants Developer a license to use such Third Party Software solely on the same terms and conditions (including all limitations and restrictions) as Developer is authorized to use the DVBA hereunder. However, Blackboard reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue Developer‚Äôs rights of use in Third Party Software to the extent required by an applicable third party licensor or supplier or the terms of Blackboard‚Äôs agreement therewith.
9. Blackboard may determine, in its sole discretion and without obligation, whether to make available any DVBA, and associated APIs and Documentation, for the purposes contemplated hereunder.
10. All rights not expressly granted to Developer are reserved by Blackboard.

<p><strong>4. BLACKBOARD OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Blackboard will provide Developer with: (a) access to the APIs and Documentation; and (b) access to the DVBA(s), in each case for Developer‚Äôs use in connection with the development of Developer Applications as contemplated hereunder. 
2. From time to time, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, Blackboard may elect to provide certain limited technical support to Developers. Any such support shall be as described in the relevant ‚ÄúDeveloper Support‚Äù or similar areas of the Portal, and may be modified, reduced, cancelled or updated at any time upon written notice provided by Blackboard in the Portal or otherwise. Any and all support will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal, and may require payment of fees as described therein. Blackboard may also make support available separately through other programs or offerings from time, and such support would be subject to the separate terms and conditions associated therewith. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>5. DEVELOPER‚ÄôS OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Developer shall develop each Developer Application in compliance with the then-current version of the APIs and Documentation and, accordingly, shall ensure that each Developer Application enables and maintains interoperability with the applicable DVBA and Blackboard Application.
2. Developer shall be solely responsible for each Developer Application, including all support, development, hosting, and maintenance thereof and its interoperability with any Blackboard Application. Accordingly, Developer shall be solely responsible and liable (including to its customers and other parties) for all matters regarding the Developer Applications, including their development, operation, performance, availability, interoperability, support, and hosting.
3. Developer shall use security best practices in connection with the development of the Developer Application and will comply at all times with all applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations and all security requirements of Blackboard made available on the Portal or otherwise. Developer will implement security measures adequate to preserve the confidentiality and security of all data which is processed, stored, transmitted or handled by Developer or any Developer Application.
4. Developer grants Blackboard the right to copy, display and otherwise use the registration information and materials provided by Developer for the purposes contemplated in the Agreement. In addition, Blackboard shall have the right (but not the obligation) to use the registration information provided by Developer in order to contact Developer to inquire as to Developer‚Äôs interest in discussing a partner relationship with Blackboard (including, by way of example and at Blackboard‚Äôs sole discretion, a relationship under which Developer may be granted deployment rights as described in Section 6 below). Neither party would have any obligations in connection with any such partner relationship unless and until the parties enter into a separate agreement (or an amendment hereto) which documents the terms and conditions of the relationship. In addition, Developer grants Blackboard the right to use Developer‚Äôs name, logo and applicable trademarks, in promotional materials and otherwise in order to promote, market and/or otherwise identify Developer as a registered developer of REST applications which are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications. 
5. Developer shall not share or expose the Developer Application Key/Secret pair. Application Key/Secret pairs shall only be held in the Developer Application code. Similarly the Developer Application must never expose the Developer Application OAuth Token. Exposing the Developer Application Key/Secret pair, or the OAuth Token will create a serious security risk. If Developer believes he/she has exposed an Application Key/Secret pair the Developer may request a new pair for the Developer Application using the Developer Portal My Applications management page. Blackboard shall in no way be responsible for lost or exposed data resulting from unapproved or inappropriate use of REST Application Key/Secret pairs or OAuth Tokens.
