<h2 id="license-questions">License Questions</h2>

<p>Academic clients should contact their Client Manager for a developer license
or questions about developer licensing. Generally, academic clients who
license our enterprise software are eligible for one license to our developer
software and 25 developer accounts. These accounts allow you to participate in
and contribute to the content on the wiki and forum areas of this site as well
as access certain developer content that requires a login to access.</p>

<p>Commercial entities are invited to join the program and purchase developer
licenses at <a href="https://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Extensions/Partnerships-Program.aspx">this link</a>. If you have lost your license file or require a change in
your license, please contact your sales representative or the partnership
program.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: <em>The developer license of our software limits the number of users, courses, and enrollments that can exist, but otherwise is a fully functional version of the product.</em></p>
