<p>Blackboard Learn Web Services are a key component of Blackboard Learn’s open
architecture, allowing you to enhance the online education experience for
their students and faculty through integration with external services and
applications. You may assemble a solution of homegrown, commercial and open
source software and tools using Learn Web Services that best meets your needs
whether it is an integration to a homegrown application or other enterprise
application, or seamless integration to a subscription database at your
library.</p>

<p>Through Blackboard Learn Web Services developers can integrate with enterprise
web applications such as Student Information Systems or custom middle-tier
services. The Learn Web Services ensure that you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provision data to Learn from external systems and vice versa.</li>
  <li>provide customizations to meet system integration and architecture needs</li>
  <li>leverage this technology to enhance and aid administration of their systems on campus</li>
  <li>automate procedures or repetitive tasks</li>
  <li>integrate with external systems or applications across your learning enterprise for example the Registrar’s office, the Library to name just two</li>
  <li>customize your implementation by integrating open source or locally-developed applications and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Data that can be accessed includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User data - name, course of study, contact information</li>
  <li>Course data and Enrollment records</li>
  <li>Outcomes - student quiz and test data, scores, grades, participation and activity data</li>
  <li>Content - the ability to seamlessly integrate rich content from a variety of sources</li>
  <li>System management - information to help administrators manage and monitor their Blackboard software installations</li>
