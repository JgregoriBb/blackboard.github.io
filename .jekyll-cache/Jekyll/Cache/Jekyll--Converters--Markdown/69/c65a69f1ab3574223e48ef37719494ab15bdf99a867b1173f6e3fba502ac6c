<hr />

<p>This is space for the community to make contributions around working with
educational technology standards. We are especially interested in standards
put forth by <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org">IMS Global</a>.
<br /><br />
Any member of the community can contribute documentation. We do not intend to
document specification completely but rather to demonstrate and document
experiences of integrating with Blackboard using these standards.</p>
