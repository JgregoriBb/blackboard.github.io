<p>The Blackboard Learn sample code contains a fully-functional client that
provides form-based interaction with all of the available SOAP-based Web
Services. This allows a Developer to interact with any of the Web Services,
see what data is required, try different combinations and permutations and
inspect the code behind it. This is a great tool to use to assist in designing
your Web Services integration, and even to troubleshoot an existing
integration from release-to-release.</p>

<p>This help article assumes that you have downloaded the <a href="About%20Web%20Services%20Sample%20Code.html">Web Services Sample
Code</a> and that you have built
the <a href="Tutirial:%20Build%The%20C#%20SOAP%20Sample%20Library.html">.NET Web Services
Library</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-build">How to Build</h3>

<p>Building the .NET Sample Client is really quite simple, once you have
generated and built the Web Services Library. The solution has already been
created, and lives in the **_<top level="" of="" client.zip="">/qa/dotnet/wsagent_**
directory. The easiest way to build it, is to open Microsoft Visual Studio
Express 2010 for C# and open the solution containing the .NET library. With
this loaded, click **File-&gt;Add...-&gt;Existing Project**. Navigate to the wsagent
directory, select wsagent2010 project, and click Open. This will add the
sample client to the existing project.</top></p>

<p>Now simply click <strong>Debug-&gt;Build</strong> and build the project. This will place an
executable called wsagent.exe in the _**<top level="" of="" client.zip="">/qa/dotnet/wsagent/bin/Debug**_ directory. You can add a link to
your desktop, start menu, or quick launch bar and launch the tool whenever you
need it.</top></p>
