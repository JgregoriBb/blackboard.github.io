<h2 id="developer-versions-of-blackboard-applications">Developer Versions of Blackboard Applications</h2>

<p>Blackboard makes developer versions of our applications available to
integrators for development work. Currently Blackboard makes available the
following developer versions of Blackboard applications (DVBAs).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Developer Amazon Machine Image</strong> (AMI) is available in the Amazon Marketplace. It is pre-built and configured to allow you to access a Learn SaaS, Ultra-enabled instance of Blackboard. You can use it to build Learning Tools Interoperability integrations (LTIs) and Blackboard REST integrations. For more information, see <a href="Using%20the%20Blackboard%20Learn%20AMI%20for%20REST%20and%20LTI%20Development.html">Using the Developer AMI</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Developer Virtual Machine</strong> (DVM) is a downloadable VirtualBox image built and managed with Vagrant. With it, you can run a local copy of Blackboard Learn for building LTIs, REST, and Building Blocks. For more information, see <a href="Developer%20Virtual%20Machine%20-%20DVM.html">Developer Virtual Machine - DVM</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blackboard Collaborate Development Instance</strong> is a SaaS-based development system that allows developers to build integrations for Blackboard Collaborate with the Ultra Experience using the Collaborate REST APIs. For access, send a request to <a href="mailto:developers@blackboard.com">developers@blackboard.com</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
