<p>Blackboard Building Blocks, a key component of Blackboard Learn‚Äôs open
architecture, allow you to enhance the online education experience for your
students and faculty. You may assemble a solution of homegrown, commercial and
open source software and tools using Blackboard Building Blocks that best
meets your needs whether it is a discipline-specific tool, an integration to a
homegrown application or other enterprise application, or seamless integration
to a subscription database at your library.</p>

<p>Through Blackboard Building Blocks, developers can create sharable, re-usable
web applications that can be deployed on Blackboard Learn. This open
architecture ensures that you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend Blackboard Learn and incorporate new functionality</li>
  <li>provide customizations to meet discipline-specific or pedagogical needs</li>
  <li>leverage this technology to enhance and aid administration of their systems on campus</li>
  <li>automate procedures or repetitive tasks</li>
  <li>integrate with external systems or applications across your learning enterprise for example the Registrar‚Äôs office, the Library to name just two</li>
  <li>customize your implementation by integrating open source or locally-developed applications and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Data that can be accessed includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authentication and authorization information - to ensure seamless authentication and authorization between Blackboard software and other systems</li>
  <li>User data - name, course of study, contact information</li>
  <li>Course data and Enrollment records</li>
  <li>Outcomes - student quiz and test data, scores, grades, participation and activity data</li>
  <li>Content - the ability to seamlessly integrate rich content from a variety of sources</li>
  <li>System management - information to help administrators manage and monitor your Blackboard software installations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="request-a-developers-license">Request a Developers License</h2>

<p>All Blackboard Learn clients receive a Blackboard developers license at no
cost. A developers license is a ‚Äúsmall footprint‚Äù version of Blackboard with
the Community and Content Management modules turned on. It can be run on a
development server or even a virtual machine image for development purposes.
If you require a developer network account visit <a href="https://blackboard.secure.force.com/">Behind the
Blackboard</a> (as an
administrator) or contact your sales representative.</p>
