<p>Administrators can link to a proxy tool descriptor which registers the tool,
places access points according to defined properties, and enables access to
the web service through the proxy tool.</p>

<p>Before registering a proxy tool, there are three <em>Global Properties</em> to keep
in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <em>Proxy Tool Registration Password</em> field to restrict access to the <em>registerTool</em> method. Proxy tools that must supply the password entered in this filed to register themselves. The proxy tool cannot login as a tool until a password is specified on the proxy tool configuration page. Proxy tools cannot receive any entitlements until granted by giving the individual proxy tool its own password.</li>
  <li>Allowing access to <em>Unknown Proxy Tools</em> means that these proxy tools can connect and use user-based authentication to access web services. A password is required and access is restricted based on the usersâ€™ entitlements within the system. Access for unknown proxy tools can be accomplished without explicitly granting them the right to use web services.</li>
  <li><em>Exposing the Tool Consumer Profile</em> allows proxy tools to auto-discover the capabilities of the system by using the URL <em>/webapps/ws/wsadmin/tcprofile</em>. Disabling this does not disable proxy tools, but it disables their ability to perform pre-registration capability validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="find-the-proxy-tools-page">Find the Proxy Tools Page</h2>

<p>Use the Proxy Tool Registration Password field to restrict access to the
registerTool method. Proxy tools that must supply the password entered in this
filed to register themselves. The proxy tool cannot login as a tool until a
password is specified on the proxy tool configuration page. Proxy tools cannot
receive any entitlements until granted by giving the individual proxy tool its
own password.</p>

<p>Allowing access to Unknown Proxy Tools means that these proxy tools can
connect and use user-based authentication to access web services. A password
is required and access is restricted based on the users entitlements within
the system. Access for unknown proxy tools can be accomplished without
explicitly granting them the right to use web services.</p>

<p>Exposing the Tool Consumer Profile allows proxy tools to auto-discover the
capabilities of the system by using the URL /webapps/ws/wsadmin/tcprofile.
Disabling this does not disable proxy tools, but it disables their ability to
perform pre-registration capability validation.</p>

  <li>Provide the <em>Vendor _and _Program</em> information.</li>
  <li>Determine the <em>Availability _of the proxy tool by clicking _Unavailable</em> or <em>Available</em>. If the proxy tool is not <em>Available</em>, then it cannot log in to any web service using any authentication methods in addition to having any requested placements disabled.</li>
  <li>Provide a <em>Shared Password</em>. The <em>Shared Password</em> is required only for tool-authenticated web service sessions.</li>
  <li>Provide individual IP addresses or a range of IP addresses to allow or block in the <em>IP Filters</em> field. Type one address per line. Using IP Filters is optional and all IP addresses are allowed by default (ALLOW<em>). Here are some guidelines for using the IP Filters:
    * Type BLOCK a.b.c.d to block an IP address or range of addresses.
    * Type ALLOW a.b.c.d to allow an IP address or range of addresses.
    * Wildcards (</em>) are allowed in any position of the IP address.
    * IP address ranges are specified using a slash as follows: a.b.c.d/e.f.g.h</li>
