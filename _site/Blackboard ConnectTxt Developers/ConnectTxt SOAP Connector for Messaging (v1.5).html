<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>

<p>This document is aimed at txttools customers who wish to send and/or receive
SMS text messages from/to their own application without using the txttools web
user interface.</p>

<p>Before reading this document and implementing a software client the reader
should have a solid understanding of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
and Extensible Markup Language (XML). In particular, the reader should
understand the HTTP request and response mechanisms and be able to create well
formed XML strings of data.</p>

<p>For more information regarding these technologies please refer to the
following guides:</p>

<p><strong>HTTP</strong></p>

<h2 id="useful-tools">Useful Tools</h2>

<p>To leverage the usability of SOAP web services you will require a SOAP client
capable of processing WSDL files and making SOAP calls to the API. Your aim is
to integrate your application/database/MIS System with the txttools SOAP API,
for which you will need to implement your own client. Java, .net, Oracle and
many other platforms provide some sort of SOAP client support framework
enabling you to create your own client as part of your application.</p>

<p>You will however require a ‘stand alone’ SOAP client which you can use to test
out the API and formulate the required XML to make a SOAP call. I suggest
using a Java based client called the Soap UI. It is platform independent and
requires the Java Runtime Environment installed which you should already have
as part of a standard Windows, MAC or Linux operating system distribution. The
Soap UI is free and may be downloaded from the following url:</p>

<p><a href="https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=http%3A//www.soapui.org/"> http://www.soapui.org/</a></p>

<p>There are many other SOAP clients out there, but for the purposes of the
tutorials and examples in this document I will assume you are using the Soap
UI.</p>

<p>You may also require some XML editing schema validation tools to help you
create and validate your XML.</p>

<p><a href="https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=http%3A//www.xmlcooktop.com/">http://www.xmlcooktop.com/</a></p>

<p>If you would like to closely inspect the HTTP traffic between your client and
the SOAP API then I suggest using the following application.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-soap">What is SOAP?</h2>

<p><strong>S</strong>imple <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>P</strong>rotocol is an implementation of Service Oriented Architecture. It is a standard method for exchanging messages in XML format between computers over a network, usually HTTP. XML data may be passed between computers over HTTP on the request and response. SOAP is an extension of this and defines a standard XML format and port of call for schema discovery. A SOAP API is usually accompanied by a Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file and it is this which should be your first port of call for information about the services available to the client.</p>

<p>For a detailed discussion of SOAP and WSDL files see:</p>

<p><a href="https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=http%3A//%2520en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP"> http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP</a></p>

<p><a href="https://commu
nity.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wik
i/Web_Services_Description_Language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language</a></p>

<p>The WSDL file is an XML document which describes the ports and end points of
services which may be invoked by a call and the XML schema expected by each
service. The schema definitions show what data is required, the format it must
be in and the nature of the response the client should expect when invoking an
operation at an end point. This document is not meant to be human readable,
however if you provide it to a client, such as the Soap UI the file will be
processed and a default request schema created for each service end point. The
client requires only the WSDL file, the service end point name and the data in
order to make a call to a service and invoke an operation.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-the-soap-api">Why use the SOAP API?</h2>

<p>txttools provides basic XML over HTTP APIs for both messaging and address book
functions. To use these APIs the client must provide an XML string in the
expected schema on the HTTP request. The SOAP mechanism is exactly the same,
its just some XML sent over HTTP on the request. So why bother using SOAP if
we already have an XML/HTTP API?</p>

<p>The reason is simple! The SOAP client does not need to know anything about the
expected XML schema prior to reading the WSDL, whereas an XML/HTTP API client
must provide the XML in the schema outlined in the documentation for that API.
The programmer creating the client must ensure the XML is hard coded with the
known schema.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to waste time hard coding String XML values into your client
then use the SOAP API rather than the old basic XML/HTTP API.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-soap-and-net">A note on SOAP and .net</h2>

<p>If you choose to use .net as your development platform, it is important to be
aware of a discrepancy between SOAP and .net. Whilst the official
specification for SOAP states that the nonce tag in the SOAP header is
optional, Microsoft makes the nonce tag mandatory. There is unfortunately no
way of removing the nonce tag from a SOAP header created programmatically by
.net. As a result, it is necessary to hard code the SOAP header in this
circumstance.</p>

<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>

<p>A client must authenticate before invoking any operation from the SOAP API.
The client must provide the username and password in plain text for the
account they wish to use. If you are using the messaging API any messages you
send will be sent from that account, and any inbox messages you retrieve will
come from that account and will be designated as ‘read’ once the API has
successfully returned them in the SOAP response.</p>

<p>If you are using the address book API you will be managing contacts and groups
from that account address book and any account which shares that address book.
You must have permission to alter the address book before invoking any Address
Book API operation.</p>

<p>All txttools SOAP APIs employ the standard Web Services Security (WSSE)
specification to define authentication credentials. The specification is
defined by Oasis Open Standards Consortium. You can find more information at
the following url:</p>

<p><a href="https://com
munity.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A//%2520www.oasisopen.%
2520org/committees/tc_home.php%3Fwg_abbrev%3Dwss"> http:// www.oasisopen. org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wss</a></p>

<p>Clients must provide their credentials in plain text in the SOAP header of the
message. It is strongly recommended you use HTTPS for all your communication
with all txttools SOAP APIs. This will secure both your authentication
credentials in the header and any information you provide in the SOAP body.</p>

<p>Clients must provide both their account username and password in the format
outlined in the example below.</p>

<soapenv:Header>

<wsse:Security soapenv:mustUnderstand="1" xmlns:wsse="http://docs.oasisopen.or
g/wss/2004/01/oasis200401wsswssecuritysecext1.0.xsd">

<h1 id="the-sms-messaging-api">The SMS Messaging API</h1>

<p>The txttools SMS Messaging WSDL file can be found at the following url:</p>

<p><a href="https://%2520w
ww.txttools.co.uk/connectors/soap/messagingk/txttoolsMessaging.wsdl%25
20"> https://
www.txttools.co.uk/connectors/soap/messagingk/txttoolsMessaging.wsdl
</a></p>

<p>Processing this WSDL file reveals one service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>txttoolsMessagingServiceBinding</li>
</ul>

<p>This service has three distinct operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Message</li>
  <li>Status</li>
  <li>InboxMessage</li>
</ul>

<p>##</p>

<h2 id="mt-sms-message-sending">MT SMS Message sending</h2>

<p>Invoking the Message operation will send a Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS text
message to the recipients phone number(s). The namespace prefix for all
elements for this operation is -sch.</p>

<p>The following table describes the elements of the XML schema for this
operation.</p>

<p><strong>Element</strong><strong>Description &amp; Format</strong><strong>Required</strong><strong>Cardinality</strong></p>

<p>MessageRequest</p>

<p>Wraps the entire messages request body</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Message</p>

<p>Warps the message request</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1 - many</p>

<p>SuppressUnicode</p>

<p>Boolean which denotes whether to override the automatic configuration of a
message to Unicode. Defaults to false if not supplied. See section on Unicode
below.</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>0-1</p>

<p>MessageText</p>

<p>The content of the SMS message. Not null. No limit on message length. If any
special characters are used then escape the entire data string using the CDATA
tag.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Recipient</p>

<p>The international prefixed mobile phone number of the intended recipient. 13 –
15 characters. First character may be ‘+’ , all others must be numeric ‘09’.
Should be unique if multiples supplied.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1 - many</p>

<p>Source</p>

<p>The source of the message. An alpha numeric value min length 1 max length 13
characters. If not supplied this will be the account default message source.</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>0-1</p>

<p>SendTime</p>

in the past.</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>0-1</p>

<p>Header</p>

<p>Binary or Hex header for UDH setting. If included, MessageText must also be in
binary or hex.</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>0-1</p>

<p>###</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Send a simple SMS message to a single recipient:</p>

<soapenv:Body>

<sch:MessageRequest>

<sch:Message>

<sch:Recipient>+447772211117</sch:Recipient>

<sch:MessageText>I love SOAP</sch:MessageText>

</sch:Message>

</sch:MessageRequest>

</soapenv:Body>

<p>Send an SMS message to multiple recipients and alter the source:</p>

<soapenv:Body>

<sch:MessageRequest>

<sch:Message>

<sch:Recipient>+447772211117</sch:Recipient>

<sch:Recipient>+447971817195</sch:Recipient>

<sch:Recipient>+447817577380</sch:Recipient>

<sch:MessageText>I love SOAP</sch:MessageText>

<sch:Source>txttools</sch:Source>

</sch:Message>

</sch:MessageRequest>

</soapenv:Body>

<h3 id="unicode">Unicode</h3>

<p>If the message text contains a character not found in the GSM charset, the
message will be sent as a Unicode message. Whilst this will ensure that all
Unicode characters are interpreted correctly, there are also some
disadvantages to consider. Firstly, not all mobile phones support full
Unicode. Secondly, each Unicode message may contain a maximum of 70 characters
only, rather than the usual 160 characters. The automatic configuration of a
message to Unicode can therefore be overridden by setting the
<strong>SuppressUnicode</strong> element to true. Bare in mind, however, that any Unicode
characters contained within the message will not be properly displayed on the
recipient’s phone. If the <strong>SuppressUnicode</strong> element is not supplied, it will
default to false.</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<p>Upon successful invocation of the Message operation the API will respond to
the client request with information regarding each message sent to each
specified recipient. This information will contain a unique ticket number for
each message sent to each recipient specified in the request. It is important
that clients record this ticket value as it can be used at a later time to
request further information about the status of the message.</p>

<p>No SOAP header values are specified in the response, only the SOAP body
contains information. The name space prefix for all body elements for this
type of response is <strong>txttoolsMessaging</strong>. The following table describes the
elements of the XML schema for the response.</p>

<p><strong>Element</strong><strong>Description &amp; Format<br />
**</strong>Required<strong>**Cardinality</strong></p>

<p>StatusResponse</p>

<p>Wraps the entire SOAP body response for all message recipient responses.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>StatusResponseType</p>

<p>Wraps each individual message recipient response.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1 - many</p>

<p>Recipient</p>

<p>The recipient phone number in international standard format to which the MT
SMS message was sent. The leading character will always be ‘+’ followed by
numeric characters.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Ticket</p>

<p>The unique ticket number for this message to the recipient phone number.
Positive integer.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>1</p>

## MT SMS Message Status Reports

As described in 3.1, when the client invokes the Message operation and sends a
Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS message the service will return a ticket value for
every recipient of that message. This ticket can be used to request status
information for that message by invoking the Status operation.

The namespace prefix for all elements for this operation is -sch.

The following table describes the elements of the XML schema for this
operation.

**Element****Description &amp; Format****Required****Cardinality**

StatusRequest

Wraps all Ticket status values for this request.

Yes

1

Ticket

Wraps the Ticket values tag for all ticket requests.

&lt;/SOAPENV: Envelope&gt;

## MO SMS Message receiving

Mobile Originating (MO) SMS messages may be directed to a txttools account
inbox and can be read online. It is also possible to retrieve unread messages
from the inbox through the SOAP API. Once retrieved, MO messages will remain
in the inbox but will be marked as 'read' and will not be eligible for
retrieval through the API.

The InboxMessage operation may be invoked by the client. The only parameter
required is the number of unread MO messages the client wishes to retrieve. If
zero all unread messages are returned in the SOAP response.

The namespace prefix for all elements for this operation is -sch.

The following table describes the elements of the XML schema for this
operation.

**Element****Description &amp; Format****Required****Cardinality**

InboxMessageRequest

Wraps the entire SOAP body response for inbox message requests.

&lt;/SOAPENV: Body&gt;

## Reports Request

The Messaging Service provides an operation which may be invoked to request an
MT message statistical report for a given period. The client may request a
report for their authenticated account or sub account of which the
authenticated account is an administrator. The client must provide a start and
end date for the period over which the report will be generated. The format
for both start and end dates is day, month and year. The periods are inclusive
of those dates.

The namespace prefix for all elements for this operation is -sch.

The following table describes the elements of the XML schema for this
operation.

**Element****Description &amp; Format  
****Required  
****Cardinality**

ReportsRequest

Wraps the entire request for a MT.

Yes

1

SubUser

&lt;/SOAPENV: Body&gt;

### Response

Following a successful invocation of the Reports operation the server will
return a SOAP response with figures for Failed (Red), Unconfirmed (Amber),
Confirmed Received (Green), and the total MT messages sent from the requested
account for the given period inclusive of the given dates.

<txttoolsMessaging:Amber>29</txttoolsMessaging:Amber>

<txttoolsMessaging:Green>5</txttoolsMessaging:Green>

<txttoolsMessaging:Total>37</txttoolsMessaging:Total>

</txttoolsMessaging:Totals>

&lt;/SOAPENV: Body&gt;

## Error Handling

Should the SOAP client attempt to invoke an operation with insufficient or
invalid data, a standard SOAP error message will be generated and returned in
the response. Failure to authenticate, due to

invalid credentials or an inactive account, will result in a WSSE
authentication error.

If the client is attempting to invoke the Message operation, the MT SMS
message(s) will not be sent to the mobile networks if a fault is reported.
Only a status &gt; 1 returned in the response denotes that

the message has been successfully received and processed by the API. If the
client receives a faul or a status of &lt; 0 the message should be retried by the
client at a later time.

# Messaging Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the process of sending an MT SMS message
through the txttools SOAP Messaging API using the Message operation. We will
then use the response data to request the status of that message and retrieve
MO SMS Message data. This tutorial will use the Soap UI, see [Useful Tools](ht
tps://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1183#jive_content_id_Useful_Tools) for
more details.

## Download and install the Soap UI client

Open up a browser and go to
[http://www.soapui.org](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=http%3A//www.soapui.org/). Download the latest free
version of the Soap UI. Ensure your computer has the Java Runtime Environment
installed.

Open the Soap UI application. If you are using a Unix based operating system
issue the following command – SOAP_UI_HOME~/bin/soapui.sh. If you are using
Windows double click the soapui.exe file. You will see the splash screen as
the application starts up followed by the Soap UI graphical user interface.

## Create a new project

Select File from the top menu bar and select New WSDL Project. Give the
project a name and enter the txttools Messaging API WSDL url:

[http:// www.txttools.co.uk/connectors/soap/messaging/txttoolsMessaging.wsdl](
https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A//%2520www.
txttools.co.uk/connectors/soap/messaging/txttoolsMessaging.wsdl)

Select to create default requests for all operations and hit OK. The Soap UI
will now process the WSDL file and create default requests for all operations.

[![Creating-a-new-WSDL-project.png](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/J
iveServlet/downloadImage/102-1183-3-24796/1195-900/Creating-a-new-WSDL-project
.png)](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1183
-3-24796/Creating-a-new-WSDL-project.png)

Fig 1: Creating a new WSDL project.

## Add the WSSE authentication header

Open up the Message operation and double click on the default request which
has been created for you. This will be called 'Request 1'. The Request Editor
window will open and you will see the entire SOAP request XML ready for you to
add some data but first you need to add the authentication header.

[![Message-request.png](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/d
ownloadImage/102-1183-3-24800/Message-request.png)](https://community.blackboa
rd.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1183-3-24800/Message-request.png)

Fig. 2: The message request.

In the properties window in bottom left you will see the various properties
and values for the request. Click in the username value field and enter your
txttools account username. Now do the

same for the password field. Right click in the request window again and click
'Add WSS Username Token'. Select 'PasswordText' and hit OK. The Soap UI will
add the standard WSSE security

header. I believe there is a bug here! Although you selected PasswordText it
may have added the credentials as a digest hash. You only want them as plain
text as you should be using Https to

secure your request. If the header looks different to those in [Authentication
](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1183#jive_content_id_Authenticatio
n) copy the example from that section cut and paste them in to the request,
and don't forget to edit the username and password values!

Your request window should now look something like the image in figure 3
below:

[![Adding-the-security-header.png](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/Ji
veServlet/downloadImage/102-1183-3-24801/Adding-the-security-header.png)](http
s://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1183-3-24801/Ad
ding-the-security-header.png)

Fig. 3: Adding the security header.

## Add some data to the Message request and invoke the operation

Now we have the header sorted out its time to add some data to the request
body and make the call to the operation. Helpfully, the Soap UI has told us
which elements are optional, we just want to send a simple message so we only
really need the MessageText and one Recipient element. Enter your mobile phone
number in international format over the '?' character in the Recipient element
tag. Enter a message in the MessageText element, you can make the message as
long as you like, i.e. more than the industry standard 160 characters. Remove
all the other optional body elements and hit the green 'play' button in the
top left corner of the request window. This will send the request and make the
call.

The Response window should open on the right hand side of the screen showing
the SOAP response to your request. Look closely for the Ticket element and
note down the integer value. We will use this later to request the status of
the message. If you sent a message to multiple recipients, or you sent more
than 160 characters in the MessageText element, you will receive more than one
StatusResponseType Element containing the initial status of each message. When
you come to implement your own SOAP client you will need to parse this
response and store each ticket value.

[![Response-to-a-message-request.png](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet
/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-1183-3-24802/Response-to-a-message-request.png)
](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1183-3-24
802/Response-to-a-message-request.png)

Fig 4: Response to a message request.

At this point you should receive the message on the phone.

## Add the ticket number to the Status operation request

Now that we have successfully sent a message we can make a request to the
Status operation and get information back concerning the statuses of the
messages we have sent. You will need the ticket number(s) for each message you
have sent.

Open up the default Status request and view the SOAP request in the request
editor window. Add the WSSE security header the same way you did for the
Message operation. There is only one body request value to enter, the
TicketNumber element. If you want to make multiple requests for different
message recipients or different messages add multiple TicketNumber elements.

Once you have formulated the request hit the 'play' button in the top left
hand corner of the request window to make the call. You should see the
response in the right hand window.

[![Status-request-and-response.png](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/J
iveServlet/downloadImage/102-1183-3-24803/Status-request-and-response.png)](ht
tps://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1183-3-24803/
Status-request-and-response.png)

You may wish to parse the response and store the status value and description
against the message so it can be presented to the users on a report.

## Make an InboxMessage operation request

The InboxMessage operation will allow you to retrieve MO messages from your
txttools inbox. To test this effectively you will first need to send some
messages from your phone into your txttools account inbox. You will need to
set up inbound messaging on your account and ensure messages are routed
directly, or by keyword, to your account inbox. If you do not have this
functionality already, contact your administrator or call the txttools support
team on 0113 2342111.

Once you have the inbox functionality set up on your account, send a message
from your phone to your inbox. You may need to include a keyword depending
upon how your account has been set up.

Open up the InboxMessage request editor and add the WSSE security header as we
did with the Message and Status operation requests. There is only only field
in the SOAP body you must populate, the InboxMessageRequest element. Enter a
zero here to request all messages from your inbox.

Hit the 'play' button in the top left hand corner of the request window and
view the response in the right hand pane.

[![InboxMessage-request-and-response.png](https://community.blackboard.com/ser
vlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-1183-3-24804/InboxMessage-request-and-respo
nse.png)](https://community.blackboard.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-1
183-3-24804/InboxMessage-request-and-response.png)

Fig. 6: InboxMessage request and response.

Once you have retrieved an inbox message it will be marked as 'read' and will
not be returned in further invocations of the InboxMessage operation
responses. Therefore, you may wish to parse and store the response data.
