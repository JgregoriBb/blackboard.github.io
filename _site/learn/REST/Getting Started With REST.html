<h2 id="get-started-with-rest">Get Started with REST</h2>

<p>Blackboard offers a suite of education technology tools, both software and
hardware. REST stands for <strong>Re</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer. It is a
lightweight, flexible web service architecture that allows HTTP commands to be
sent to Web Applications without unnecessary overhead. We provide specific
examples and tutorials about using Blackboard REST APIs, particularly when a
workflow is more complicated. For more general questions about REST and using
REST APIs, see any of the numerous tutorials available online. Most commonly
used resources include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blackboard’s <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com/">developer portal</a></li>
  <li>Blackboard’s <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=BBDN-REST">Github repos</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="before-you-get-started">Before You Get Started</h2>

<p>Blackboard offers lots of tools to help you develop an application, plugin, or
other integration for use with Blackboard products like Blackboard Learn and
Blackboard Collaborate. The most important ones are your accounts with these
sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blackboard Developer Portal</strong> is where you register applications so they can work with Blackboard products. It’s also where you get your own key and secret that you need to authenticate your application with Blackboard products.</li>
  <li><strong>Blackboard Developer Community</strong> is where you learn to develop with Blackboard products, get the latest news, and discuss with other Blackboard integrators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the Developer Portal and Developer Community require separate
accounts.</p>

<h2 id="register-as-a-blackboard-developer">Register as a Blackboard Developer</h2>

<p>Blackboard Learn REST integrations begin at the Developer Portal. This is
where you register REST Applications and get the ID, key, and secrets. In the
portal, you can see which client systems are using the integrations. Signing
up is free, and you can develop your integration at no cost. There may be cost
involved in deploying your integration, but before that happens, you’ll have
to speak with us. To discuss deploying your application, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:developers@blackboard.com">developers@blackboard.com</a>.Before you can
authenticate your project with Blackboard applications, you need to be a
registered Blackboard developer.To register as a Blackboard developer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com/">https://developer.blackboard.com/</a> and select <strong>Sign Up</strong>. Read and agree to the terms and conditions.</li>
  <li>Provide your email address, a password, your first name and last, and select the checkbox to prove you are human.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Create Account</strong> and you’re on your way.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more information about the Developer Portal please see <a href="Register%20as%20a%20Developer%20and%20Manage%20Your%20Applications%20with%20the%20Developer%20Portal.html">this document</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are a Blackboard client, a Blackboard Partner / Vendor / Developer of a REST Application should NEVER tell you to go to the developer portal and create an App ID with the associated key/secret to install their application. They should never tell you to apply for a Rate/Site increase for their application. Blackboard DOES NOT support that model. Every REST Application developer should give you an App ID to install their REST App and tell you how to configure a system role for its use. Period. The REST Application developer needs to request the increases they need to run their application themselves. If they ask you to go to developer.blackboard.com and get an App ID/Key/Secret, please tell them that is wrong. They should have exactly one App ID for their production REST application that they are asking you to install.</p>

<p>Contractors are an exception to this policy as they are producing an
integration on your, the Blackboard client, behalf. Questions regarding the
policy and whether you are impacted may be asked here, or posted to
<a href="mailto:developers@blackboard.com">developers@blackboard.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="join-the-community">Join the Community</h2>

<p>The Blackboard developer community is the best place to find more information
about integrating your project with Blackboard products. You will benefit from
the community most by joining in.To register in the Blackboard developer
community:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://community.blackboard.com">Blackboard Developer Community</a> and select <strong>Register</strong>.</li>
  <li>If your organization is a Blackboard client or partner organization and you have a Behind the Blackboard login, select <strong>Behind the Blackboard Login</strong>. Otherwise, select <strong>Community Site Login</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter your email address to receive a link via email.</li>
  <li>In your email’s inbox, find the email sent by Blackboard. You might have to check your spam or junk folder. The email’s subject is something like <em>Blackboard Community: Email Validation</em>. Select the link in your email. You will be taken to a registration page.</li>
  <li>In the registration page, complete all the required fields and select <strong>Create Account</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-blackboard-application-do-i-need">What Blackboard Application Do I Need?</h2>

<p>Your Blackboard-compatible application can work with one or more of
Blackboard’s tools. How you build an integration with Blackboard software and
hardware depends on which tools you want to integrate with. The tools you’ll
want to use depend on what you want to do.</p>

<h2 id="get-development-instances-of-blackboard-applications">Get Development Instances of Blackboard Applications</h2>

<p>Blackboard makes available instances of Blackboard applications that you can
use to build projects that integrate with Blackboard applications. Among
others, we offer these popular developer instances. Blackboard does not charge
a fee for entry-level use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/dvba/Using%20the%20Blackboard%20Learn%20AMI%20for%20REST%20and%20LTI%20Development.html">AWS instance of Blackboard Learn</a><br />
While Blackboard does not charge for entry-level use, AWS may charge various
fees for their services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/collab/Getting%20Started%20With%20The%20Blackboard%20Collaborate%20REST%20APIs.html">Developer access to Blackboard Collaborate</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about developer versions of Blackboard applications, see
<a href="/dvba/What%20is%20a%20DVBA%3F.html">Developer Versions of Blackboard
Applications</a>.</p>

<h2 id="developing-with-blackboard-collaborate">Developing with Blackboard Collaborate</h2>

<p>Things are a little different for developing with Blackboard Collaborate. For
more information, see the <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/BBDN/collaborate-api/1.0.0">Collaborate REST API Reference</a> and
then email us at at
<a href="mailto:developers@blackboard.com">developers@blackboard.com</a>. We’ll set you
up with a key and secret for Blackboard Collaborate. Then read about how to
use your key and secret to <a href="/collab/Authorize%20and%20Authenticate%20In%20Blackboard%20Collaborate.html">authenticate with
Collaborate</a>. The rest of the present topic
pertains only to developing with Blackboard Learn.</p>

<h2 id="developing-with-blackboard-learn">Developing with Blackboard Learn</h2>

<p>Go to the developer portal and <a href="Register%20as%20a%20Developer%20and%20Manage%20Your%20Applications%20with%20the%20Developer%20Portal.html">register as a Developer</a> if you haven’t already, and then register your
application to get a key and secret. Use your key and secret to <a href="Basic%20Authentication.html">authenticate
with Learn</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/129105.png" alt="developer workflow" /></p>

<h2 id="look-at-the-learn-rest-reference">Look at the Learn REST Reference</h2>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi/Learn">Learn REST API
Reference</a>. In particular,
look at the range of endpoints available. Check the <strong>Since</strong> version for
endpoint that interest you. This version number indicates the version since
which the endpoint has been available. This way, you can make sure that your
Blackboard server is is able to use it.</p>

<h2 id="authenticationauthorization">Authentication/Authorization</h2>

<p>Authentication for REST Integrations follows the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0 RFC
Standard</a>. Essentially,
every developer has a unique key and secret associated with each application
they create. They make an HTTP Post to the API requesting client_credentials,
which returns an authorization token that grants the application access to the
Learn REST API for one hour. This token is then passed in subsequent REST
calls until such time that the token expires. This can be done either with
<a href="Basic%20Authentication.html">Basic
Authentication</a> or, as of Blackboard Learn 3200.7 in SaaS or Q4 2017 for
self- and managed-hosted clients, using <a href="Three-Legged%20OAuth.html">Three-Legged
OAuth</a>.</p>

<h2 id="calling-services">Calling Services</h2>

<p>Once your application acquires an access token, it only needs to pass that
token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of your API calls. Review
the authentication documentation in the above section for an overview, or find
more specific details on the available API endpoints and APIs on the Developer
Portal’s <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi">Swagger API document</a>.In
its current implementation, Blackboard Learn REST APIs does not support Cross-
Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). To learn about this and see an example to
workaround this with Angular2, see the blog entitled <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/blogs/4/17">Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing; or Why I Can’t Use AJAX with Learn APIs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configure-an-instance-of-learn-to-work-with-your-application">Configure an Instance of Learn to Work with Your Application</h2>

<p>Once you have registered with the developer portal and built an integration,
deploying to a Blackboard Learn SaaS instance is a simple step. The Blackboard
Learn administrator that wants to use your integration needs the Application
ID you got from the developer portal. The administrator will also need to
create a Blackboard Learn user account with sufficient entitlements to
associate with your integration. This gives the administrator full control
over the entitlements used by your application. For more information on how to
configure Learn, please see <a href="Managing%20REST%20Integrations%20in%20Learn.html">Managing REST Integrations in Learn: The REST
Integrations Tool for System
Administrators</a>.</p>
