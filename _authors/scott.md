Hi, I'm Scott Hurrey. I have been at Blackboard for 10.5 years. I work on the Developer Relations and Standards team in the Product Development and Delivery organization.

I love hanging out with my two kids. I love sports and beer. I love writing code... especially Python. I love integrating with and customizing software. I love spending time getting to know the community members from around the world!
