Hi, I'm Eric Preston. I have been at Blackboard for more than 13 years. I work on the Developer Relations and Standards team in the Product Development and Delivery organization. I'm active with the IMS Global LTI and Caliper working groups.

I'm passionate about improving education technology, working with integrators, playing classical guitar, photographing birds, and raising a 4th grader.
