Hi, I'm Mark O'Neil. I have been at Blackboard for 10 years. I work on the Product Management team and am responsible for our Platfrom and API management.
Things I dig doing: 
- hanging out with family
- remideling my house
- riding my motorcycles
- making stuff
I enjoy tech in all aspects - especially servers and coding. Docker and node.js are my current favs. 
I love hanging out with the community problem solving, researching and developing solutions.
