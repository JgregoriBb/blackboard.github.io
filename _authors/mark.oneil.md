Hi, I'm Mark O'Neil. 

I have been at Blackboard for 10 years. I work on the Product Management team and am responsible for our Platfrom and API management.

Things I dig doing: 
- hanging out with family
- remodeling my house
- riding my motorcycles
- making stuff

I enjoy tech in all aspects - especially servers and coding. Docker and node.js are my current favs. 
I love hanging out getting to know folks in the community, problem solving, researching and developing solutions.
