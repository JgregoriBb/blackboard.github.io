Hackboard is open to folks in the US regardless of their affiliation -- or
lack there of -- with Blackboard. As such, some contestants may not have
access to Behind the Blackboard to download the [Blackboard Learn 9.1 Q2 2017
Developer Virtual Machine](https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa
?url=https%3A//behind.blackboard.com/downloads/details.aspx%3Fd%3D1779
) to build their application against. For these folks, we are providing a
version of the Q2 2017 Virtual Machine valid through July 31, 2017. This will
allow you to develop your application, record your demo, and use at DevCon and
BbWorld should you be selected as a winner.

Here are the downloadable files you will need:

  * [Vagrantfile](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvm/hackboard/Vagrantfile) (587 b)
  * [bb-learn-hackboard-expires-july31.box](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvm/hackboard/bb-learn-hackboard-expires-july31.box) (5.5 Gb)

To learn more about how to set up vagrant and use this environment, read
[Developer Virtual Machine -
DVM](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1649-developer-virtual-machine-
dvm), and as always, if you have any questions, email us at
[developers@blackboard.com](mailto:developers@blackboard.com).
