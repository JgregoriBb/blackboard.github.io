Office hours are regular meetings geared toward technical discussion about
developing and administering Blackboard Learn. Our community holds both Admin
and Developer office hours on a weekly alternate schedule, so you can join the
discussion and learn from others' ideas, questions, tricks, and tips. Refer to
the [calendar on the Blackboard Learn Developers
page](https://community.blackboard.com/community/developers/learn) to see
which session is coming up.

Every other sessions will be an open communication session - these will not be
recorded (NR). We will hear your complaints, your praises, your needs both in
the API and in the presentations that we give in the non-open-communication
sessions. Presentations will be recorded (R) and archived below.

Registration is not required for Developer Office Hours. Note that the regular
schedule is 11:00AM-12:00PM Eastern - though in some cases to accommodate
presenters the schedule may shift, please confirm sessions via the Community
Calendar.
