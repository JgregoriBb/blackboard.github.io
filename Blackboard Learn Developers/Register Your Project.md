Blackboard Learn projects need to be registered with the Blackboard cloud.
Registration identifies projects and allows Blackboard to study usage. When a
project moves to production, registration helps Blackboard validate projects.
If you intend to share a project with the broader Blackboard community,
registration makes that possible. Your project will not work with Blackboard
Learn even on a development basis unless you register it first. Registration
consists in the following steps, some of which might already be completed for
you.

  1. [Register your development version of Blackboard Learn to the cloud](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1664-register-dvm-to-the-cloud).
  2. [Register your application in the Developer Portal](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-4566-register-your-application).

When you register your application, the Developer Portal gives you a key and
secret. The key/secret combination is unique, identifies your application, and
cannot be retrieved. You must write them down someplace safe and treat them as
credentials. You use them as part of the process to authenticate your
application with Blackboard Learn instances.
