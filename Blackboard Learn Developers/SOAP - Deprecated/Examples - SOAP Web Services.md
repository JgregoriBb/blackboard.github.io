<hr />
This section will include concrete examples illustrating the use of the
Blackboard Learn Web Services performing specific tasks in an effort to show
how the Developer can build an application.

This section will use different languages to make different Web Service calls,
so Developers will have a variety of samples to choose from, depending upon
the end goal and the language of choice.
