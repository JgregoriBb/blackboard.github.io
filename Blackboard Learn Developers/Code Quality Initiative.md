# Code Quality Initiative
# Why Code Quality Matters

  * Your code is your asset
  * Keeps your cost down as you grow
  * Increase robustness, maintainability, security, performance, scalability, extensibility, etc.
  * Prevention is the best medicine

# Challenges with Code Quality

  * Often talked about in theory but not actually practiced
  * Hard to measure or prove
  * Difficult to plan and prioritize

# Sonar â€“ Quality Management Platform

  * Open source and extensible
  * Manages code quality with:
    * Views of all projects at a glace, drill down to source code, differential, hotspots
    * Coding Rules
    * Unit Tests
    * Standard Metrics
    * Time Machine
    * Integration with tools such as PMD, Findbugs, Checkstyle, JSLint, Clover, Cobetura, Hudson (many plugins available)

# Static Code Analysis (SCA)

  * Applies rules to find potential bugs, anti-patterns, and code style violations
  * Catches problems as early as possible in the development process
  * A well-established industry practice for validating the quality of source code
  * Can be automated and tracked by tools like Sonar
