NOTE: SOAP Web Services have been deprecated. See [Blackboard Deprecates SOAP
Web Services](https://community.blackboard.com/community/developers/blog/2019/
01/04/blackboard-deprecates-soap-web-services) Much of their functionality
will not work with Ultra, including with Ultra Courses.

Blackboard Web Services offer out-of-process integration points for Third-
Party Developers interested in extending the Learn platform without creating a
Building Block or using Java.

The Web Services are based on SOAP and utilize WS_Security tokens for secure
transmission of data between two entities. They can be accessed remotely and
are programming language-agnostic, allowing for maximum flexibility of the
developer's skill set, while still providing a substantial set of APIs for
reading and writing data.

## Getting Started

In the [Getting Started
](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1116)section you will find
instructions for setting up your development environment, generating a
reusable .NET or Java library for use in your application from sample code
available inside the Blackboard Learn User Interface, and building the QA app,
which allows you to test all of the Blackboard Web Services with a pre-built,
functioning desktop application.

## Examples

These [examples](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1117) are are
provided as reference implementations of API the usage of Blackboard Web
Service end points to interact with Blackboard Learn from various languages,
such as C#, Java and PHP.

## Tutorials

These [tutorials](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1118) are provided
as short ramp up for concepts and APIs behind the development of Web Service
integrations.
