## Account questions

Your Behind the Blackboard account will provide you with authenticated access
to Developer Resources. Any Behind the Blackboard account is able to post to
our discussion forums. If you would like to identify as a Blackboard
developer, please e-mail your Blackboard Client Manager and request developer
access for your Behind the Blackboard account.

Anyone who had an existing account as a Blackboard Developer or Blackboard
Partner has full access to this site. Accounts from legacy developer network
sites have been migrated.

New developer account requests should be directed to your Blackboard Client
Manager. Accounts will be provided to existing Blackboard clients and to
partners enrolled in our Blackboard Developers Network program according to
our contractual terms. If you do not know who your Client Manager is, please
contact your institution's Blackboard System Administrator or primary business
relationship owner. He or she will know who to contact.

To reset forgotten passwords, please visit [Behind the
Blackboard](https://community.blackboard.com/external-

your password?" link. A new password will be e-mailed to your account.

## License Questions

Academic clients should contact their Client Manager for a developer license
or questions about developer licensing. Generally, academic clients who
license our enterprise software are eligible for one license to our developer
software and 25 developer accounts. These accounts allow you to participate in
and contribute to the content on the wiki and forum areas of this site as well
as access certain developer content that requires a login to access.

Commercial entities are invited to join the program and purchase developer
licenses at [this link](https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?ur

your license, please contact your sales representative or the partnership
program.

**IMPORTANT**: _The developer license of our software limits the number of users, courses, and enrollments that can exist, but otherwise is a fully functional version of the product._
