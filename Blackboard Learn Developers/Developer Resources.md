## Setting Up

If you are setting up your development environment for Building Block
development you will find useful information under the [Building Blocks
Getting Started](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1113-getting-
started-with-building-blocks) section of Developer Resources. If you are
getting started developing Web Services for Blackboard Learn you may be
interested in the [Web Services Getting Started
](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1116)section of Developer
Resources.

## Building Blocks

Building Blocks allow you to plug additional capabilities into the product
(such as in the course control panel or user tools areas) and can appear as
new portal modules, as custom content types, and as links throughout many
areas of the product user interface.

(SIS) via a variety of batch-driven and event-driven capabilities.
Additionally, the integration APIs are documented for custom integrations.

Web services allow you to remotely connect to Blackboard Learn using virtually
any programming language of your choosing. Blackboard Learn ships with
instructions for accessing the web services using Java and .NET.

## Proxy Tools

Proxy Tools allow learning tools hosted externally to Blackboard Learn to
appear tightly integrated into the course environment. Proxy Tools allow new
models of connecting learning tools across institutions and systems.

## Template Variables

Template variables can be used throughout the product to dynamically render
course content just about everywhere the content editor is used.
