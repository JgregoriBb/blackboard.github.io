You've run into the "Unconnected sockets not implemented error" in a Q4 2015
Developer Virtual Machine. What can you do? This article will help. There is a
patch that fixes the error, LRNSI-21817, but the Q4 2015 DVM is built from a
slightly different version of Learn than what went GA. Hence an attempt to
apply the patch will fail, telling you that the patch isn't meant for the
version of Learn you are running. What I did, and it worked for me, is to
download the patch, unzip it, modify the bbpatch.mf file so that the DVM
version is included in the list of compatible versions, re-build the patch,
and apply it. Because there are no database changes involved, just inserting a
couple of class files, BbPatch.sh ran without a hitch with this modified file.
Following are the details. Hope this helps another developer!
