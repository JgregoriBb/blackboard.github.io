In August 2016, our friends at
[AllTheDucks](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=https%3A//alltheducks.com/) presented on their work
integrating with the Blackboard Learn REST APIs using
[Golang](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=https%3A//golang.org/). Following DevCon ANZ, the Ducks
were kind enough to open source their project and write a blog to help
developers learn the Golang REST Application they wrote.

The blog can be found [here](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
