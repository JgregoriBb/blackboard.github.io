## 1. What does "ULTRA READY" mean?

The "ULTRA READY" badge indicates that the App is supported and compatible with the Ultra Experience of Blackboard Learn. any integration listed as “Ultra Ready” is labeled as such to indicate it was built leveraging only Blackboard integration frameworks specifically supported in Ultra (i.e. Partner Cloud, LTI 1.1+ and/or Learn REST APIs).  The term “Ultra Ready” is not equivalent to a Blackboard certification status for the Ultra experience. The designation of “Ultra Ready” is made by the developer of the integration and not by Blackboard and, as such, does not designate a Blackboard certification status for the Ultra experience.*

## 2. What's the difference between the 3 integration types (LTI + REST, Building Blocks, & Partner Cloud)?

LTI + REST: LTI + REST apps are those integrations that rely on and utilize LTI Tool Placements and/or Blackboard Learn REST APIs. LTI + REST apps are compatible across all flavors and delivery methods of Blackboard Learn (Original and Ultra experiences) and have no association with legacy Blackboard Building Blocks.

Building Block: While fully functional only in the Original Experience of Blackboard Learn, for any Building Blocks that are installed on a Blackboard Learn environment with the Ultra Experience enabled, the functionality of the integration will only be available in courses using the Original course view. Building Block functionality is not compatible with the Ultra experience of Learn including anywhere within the Ultra base navigation (outside of the course context) or within Ultra view courses.

Partner Cloud: Natively available in all flavors and delivery methods of Blackboard Learn (Original and Ultra experiences), Partner Cloud Apps and have no association with a legacy Blackboard Building Block. The Blackboard Partner Cloud streamlines our inventory of content integrations into a single registration and activation process, eliminates Building Block version control issues, and accelerates the delivery of new partner features and product updates. Via the course-embedded Content Market tool, instructors and course builders can access ready-made material from textbook publishers to enhance their curriculum and provide students with supplementary materials that aid in learning. At the same time, sensitive student data remains private and secure.
