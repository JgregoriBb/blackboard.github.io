<hr />
This is space for the community to make contributions around working with
educational technology standards. We are especially interested in standards
put forth by [IMS Global](https://www.imsglobal.org).
<br /><br />
Any member of the community can contribute documentation. We do not intend to
document specification completely but rather to demonstrate and document
experiences of integrating with Blackboard using these standards.
