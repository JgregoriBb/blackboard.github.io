On April 10, 2019, Eric Preston, Blackboard's resident LTI expert, spoke with us in Technical Office Hours. He gave us an overview of LTI technology. [Watch recording the recording in Bb Collaborate.](https://us.bbcollab.com/collab/ui/session/playback/load/53618fbbef8b45628ff9b18f407d7456)


On May 1, 2019, Eric followed up with another, deeper dive into coding an LTI integration. [Watch the recording in Bb Collaborate](https://us.bbcollab.com/recording/e193c6cb59cb4ed1a776c271665d4154). [This is the associated slide deck.](https://slack-files.com/TFA153DM0-FJFEJH8NB-fbe304b473))
