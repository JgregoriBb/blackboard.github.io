# Introduction to the Collaborate Developer Community
Welcome to the Blackboard Collaborate™ Developer Community. Blackboard
Collaborate is a simple, convenient, and reliable online collaborative
learning solution. This solution delivers a level of engagement that makes
learners feel like they’re together in the same room via collaboration and
conference tools.

The Collaborate Developer Community is broken up into four main areas:

  * **[Getting Started with Collaborate REST APIs](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1787-getting-started-with-the-blackboard-collaborate-rest-apis)**

Get up to speed quickly with the new REST APIs available for Blackboard
Collaborate with the Ultra Experience. These APIs give the developer the
ability to integrate common Collaborate functionality into a web application
using REST APIs.

  * **[API Documentation](https://community.blackboard.com/community/developers/collaborate/pages/api-documentation)**

Blackboard provides reference documentation for REST APIs.

  * **[Migration from SOAP to REST](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1788-migration-from-soap-to-rest)**

Blackboard is phasing in REST APIs as the preferred method of integration. If
you have an earlier SOAP-based intregration, you can migrate it to use the new
API endpoints.

  * **[Discussions](https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A%2F%2FfilterID%3Dcontentstatus%5Bpublished%5D%7Eobjecttype%7Eobjecttype%5Bthread%5D%26browseSite%3Dplace-content%26containerType%3D14%26userIDs%3D2011%26containerID%3D2055%26browseViewID%3DplaceContent%2F)**
